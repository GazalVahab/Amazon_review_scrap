Roasted Red chilly definately.Don't ever think of giving it to the kids unless they love hot(chilli hot) food. Personally, I have never met any children who can eat this much chilli. Even the adults at my home were all watering from the nose after eating this.I've even tried putting half the masala in one Maggi cake but the chilly is so overpowering that it turns out even worse. I dunno, why would anyone ruin a perfectly good formula?So, in a nutshell, it's Maggi with chilly powder. Not for kids. Definitely not for adults either, especially, who don't like chilly.This seems to be a formula made by some European or US MBA graduate. Usually, for Non-Asians, spicy is lots of chilly.

{"asin": "B07JQNB7QG", "text": "It's very difficult to improve upon perfection, coke and Pepsi had both tried to improve their products but failed miserably every time. Nestle India had the same problem with Maggi Masala, which is pure perfection. but with the advent of competition, Maggi had to come up with a follow-up killer product. I'm glad to say that they have managed to do just that. Yes, it's spicier, yes it will leave your face flushed, but by God, I just can't stop shovelling it down my mouth. It's just that good. I for one am a strong believer now.Nestle/ Maggi have gotten what is every FMCG company dreams about a completely untapped market segment with literally no competition in sight.  Kudos for whoever came up with this blend of spices.", "title": "Finally a follow up to the Brilliant Maggi Masala", "location_and_date": "Reviewed in India on September 18, 2020", "verified": true, "rating": "5.0"},

{"asin": "B07JQNB7QG", "text": "Yes, the proportion of red chillies (4.5% powder + 3% bits) is a bit on the higher side, so much so that it almost ruins the entire flavor. The chilly powder wasn't necessary when they already have crushed chillies. Instead it could have been replaced with a bit of black pepper(which is only 0.6%) or even paprika for color. Otherwise the masala blend is more or less ok and kudos to Nestle for introducing Indian flavors in Maggi. Here are some options to deal with the extra pungency:1) add some extra tomato, peas and vegetables to neutralize the pungency of the chilly flavor2) mixing noodle cakes and tastemakers from this and the vanilla masala pack.3) Use 1 spicy tastemaker sachet per 2 noodle cakes (with vegs to compensate flavor). You can use the remaining tastemaker sachets in your normal cooking.This is supposed to be a spicy preparation and may not be palatable for those who can barely tolerate mildly spicy stuff. I would gladly accept the red chillies as an upgrade over their MSG even if its a tiny bit.", "title": "Tastemaker masala has 9% red chilli and pepper", "location_and_date": "Reviewed in India on April 25, 2020", "verified": true, "rating": "3.0"},
